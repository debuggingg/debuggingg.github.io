### Object Serialization

This Java program demonstrates how to serialize and deserialize objects using the `Serializable` interface. It includes a class (`Member`) designed to store member information such as ID, name, and email, and details the process of converting an object to a byte stream and vice versa.



#### Concepts:

1. **Serialization:** 
   - The process of converting an object into a byte stream for input/output operations.
   - Allows an object to be transmitted over a network or saved to a file.

2. **Serializable Interface:**
   - Marker interface:  A marker interface with no methods to implement.
   - Indicates that a class can be serialized, converting all its fields to a byte stream.

3. **Externalizable Interface:**
   - Extends `Serializable` and includes two methods: `writeExternal(ObjectOutput out)` and `readExternal(ObjectInput in)`.
   - Allows custom serialization of specific fields.

---

#### Implementation Steps:

1. **Implementing Serializable Interface:**
   - Class must implement the `Serializable` interface.
   - No methods need to be overridden.

2. **Defining serialVersionUID:**
   - Recommended to declare a `serialVersionUID` field to identify versions of the class.
   - Ensures compatibility during the deserialization process.
   - Declared as `private static final long serialVersionUID`.

### Example:
**Member Class:**
Designed to store member information and implement serialization.
~~~


public class Member implements Serializable {
    // Unique ID for serialization
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 7579722335991274252L;

    private String id;
    private String name;
    private String email;

    // Default constructor
    public Member() {
    }

    // Parameterized constructor
    public Member(String id, String name, String email) {
        super();
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.email = email;
    }

    // Getters and setters
    public String getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId(String id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getEmail() {
        return email;
    }

    public void setEmail(String email) {
        this.email = email;
    }

    // toString method for string representation of the object
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "[아이디 = " + id + ", name = " + name + ", email = " + email + "]";
    }
}

- **Class Declaration:**
  - `public class Member implements Serializable`:
    - Declares the `Member` class as serializable.

- **serialVersionUID:**
  - `private static final long serialVersionUID = 7579722335991274252L;`
    - Ensures that the class's version during serialization is compatible with the version during deserialization.

- **Constructors:**
  - Default constructor for creating an empty `Member` object.
  - Parameterized constructor for creating a `Member` object with specified ID, name, and email.

- **Getters and Setters:**
  - Methods to access and modify the fields `id`, `name`, and `email`.

- **toString Method:**
  - Provides a string representation of the `Member` object, useful for debugging and logging.

---

#### Usage:
To serialize a `Member` object, you would create an `ObjectOutputStream` and use its `writeObject` method. To deserialize, you would use an `ObjectInputStream` and its `readObject` method, casting the result back to a `Member` object. 

This class setup ensures that `Member` objects can be easily serialized and deserialized, making it useful for storing and transferring member information.

# ObjectOutputStram: Saving Member Information to a File

#### Dont Forget:
writes the `Member` object to the file. once you open the file, it has object information. not the text information becuase we writeObject the object info. 

**Purpose:**
This Java program demonstrates how to save `Member` objects to a file using object serialization. The program creates `Member` objects and writes them to a file, enabling their data to be persisted and later retrieved.

---

#### Concepts:

1. **ObjectOutputStream:**
   - A class used to write primitive data types and Java objects to an output stream.
   - Requires an underlying `OutputStream` (e.g., `FileOutputStream`).

2. **Serialization:**
   - The process of converting an object into a byte stream, making it possible to save the object to a file or transmit it over a network.
   - Involves implementing the `Serializable` interface in the class definition.

3. **NotSerializableException:**
   - Thrown if an object that is not serializable is attempted to be serialized.
   - Ensure that classes of objects to be serialized implement the `Serializable` interface.

---

#### Implementation Steps:

1. **Create ObjectOutputStream:**
   - Use a `FileOutputStream` to specify the file path.
   - Wrap it with an `ObjectOutputStream` to write objects to the file.

2. **Write Member Objects:**
   - Create `Member` objects with relevant data.
   - Use the `writeObject` method of `ObjectOutputStream` to serialize and write the objects to the file.

3. **Handle Exceptions:**
   - Ensure the `Member` class implements `Serializable` to avoid `NotSerializableException`.

### Example:
**MemberSaveApp:**
This program saves member information to a file using object serialization.

~~~


public class MemberSaveApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        // Create an ObjectOutputStream to write objects to the file
        ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("c:/data/member.txt"));

        // Write Member objects to the file
        // Ensure the Member class implements Serializable to avoid NotSerializableException
        out.writeObject(new Member("abc123", "홍길동", "abc@itwill.xyz"));
        out.writeObject(new Member("opq456", "임꺽정", "opq@itwill.xyz"));
        out.writeObject(new Member("xyz789", "전우치", "xyz@itwill.xyz"));

        // Close the stream
        out.close();

        System.out.println("c:\\data\\member.txt 파일에 회원정보를 저장 하였습니다.");
    }
}
~~~

---

#### Explanation:

- **Creating ObjectOutputStream:**
  - `ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("c:/data/member.txt"));`
    - Creates a new `ObjectOutputStream` that writes to the specified file path.

- **Writing Objects:**
  - `out.writeObject(new Member("abc123", "홍길동", "abc@itwill.xyz"));`
    - Serializes and writes the `Member` object to the file.
  - Repeat for additional `Member` objects.

- **Closing the Stream:**
  - `out.close();`
    - Closes the output stream to ensure all data is flushed and resources are released.

- **Serializable Interface:**
  - The `Member` class must implement `Serializable` to allow its objects to be serialized.

This setup ensures that `Member` objects can be easily saved to a file, enabling persistent storage and later retrieval.

# ObjectInputStream Member Information from a File

This Java program demonstrates how to load and display `Member` objects that were previously saved to a file. The program reads `Member` objects from the file using object deserialization and prints their details to the console.

---

#### Concepts:

1. **ObjectInputStream:**
   - A class used to read primitive data types and Java objects from an input stream.
   - Requires an underlying `InputStream` (e.g., `FileInputStream`).

2. **Deserialization:**
   - The process of converting a byte stream back into a copy of the original object.
   - Involves implementing the `Serializable` interface in the class definition to ensure objects can be deserialized.

3. **EOFException:**
   - Thrown when the end of the input stream is reached unexpectedly.
   - Used to detect the end of the file when reading objects in a loop.

---

#### Implementation Steps:

1. **Create ObjectInputStream:**
   - Use a `FileInputStream` to specify the file path.
   - Wrap it with an `ObjectInputStream` to read objects from the file.

2. **Read Member Objects:**
   - Use a loop to read and deserialize `Member` objects from the file.
   - Catch `EOFException` to detect the end of the file and break the loop.

3. **Handle Exceptions:**
   - Ensure the `Member` class implements `Serializable` to allow its objects to be deserialized.
   - Handle `EOFException` to properly end the reading loop.

#### Full Code 
Example:

**MemberLoadApp:**
This program loads member information from a file and prints it to the console.

```java
epublic class MemberLoadApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
        // Create an ObjectInputStream to read objects from the file
        ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream("c:/data/member.txt"));

        System.out.println("<<회원목록>>");

        while (true) {
            try {
                // Read and deserialize Member objects from the file
                // Break the loop if EOFException is caught
                Member member = (Member) in.readObject();
                System.out.println(member); // Automatically calls Member's toString() method
            } catch (EOFException e) {
                break;
            }
        }

        // Close the input stream
        in.close();
    }
}
```

---

#### Explanation:

- **Creating ObjectInputStream:**
  - `ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream("c:/data/member.txt"));`
    - Creates a new `ObjectInputStream` that reads from the specified file path.

- **Reading Objects:**
  - `Member member = (Member) in.readObject();`
    - Deserializes and reads a `Member` object from the file.
  - `System.out.println(member);`
    - Prints the `Member` object, automatically calling its `toString()` method.

- **Handling EOFException:**
  - The `EOFException` is caught to detect the end of the file and break the reading loop.
  - This ensures that the program stops reading when no more objects are available in the file.

- **Closing the Stream:**
  - `in.close();`
    - Closes the input stream to release resources.

This setup allows the program to successfully read and display `Member` objects from a file, enabling the retrieval and display of previously saved member information.
