# Oracle SQL

-  How to execute SQL statements written in the worksheet on the connected Oracle server
-  [CTRL]+[ENTER]: Execute the SQL statement at the cursor position
-  [F5]: Execute all SQL statements written in the worksheet
-  You can specify a range using the keyboard (mouse) and execute the SQL statements within the range using [CTRL]+[ENTER] or [F5]
-  The execution results of the SQL statements written in the worksheet are displayed in the [Script Output] or [Query Result] window

-  SQL statements are case- insensitive and are processed as a single command by the worksheet. Use the semicolon (;) symbol to indicate the end of a statement.
-  Oracle system command to check the name of the user currently connected to the server

```SHOW USER;```

---
## Table
---

-  Table (TABLE): The most basic object for storing data in a row- by- row manner in a database -  ENTITY
-  Check the list of tables (existing) in the user schema that the user currently connected to the server can access


```SELECT TABLE_NAME FROM USER_TABLES;```

```SELECT TABLE_NAME FROM TABS;```

```SELECT * FROM TAB;```


-  Check table structure: Table properties (ATTRIBUTE) -  column names and data types
-  Format) DESC table_name
-  EMP table: Table to store employee information

```DESC EMP;```

-  DEPT table: Table to store department information

```DESC DEPT;```

-  DQL (DATA QUERY LANGUAGE): Data query language -  SQL commands to retrieve rows stored in tables
-  SELECT: SQL command to retrieve one or more rows stored in tables
-  Format) SELECT retrieval_target, retrieval_target,... FROM table_name
-  SQL command to retrieve all rows stored in a single table
-  retrieval_target: *(all columns) -  Cannot be used with other retrieval targets, column name, expression, function, etc.

```SELECT * FROM EMP;```

```SELECT EMPNO, ENAME, SAL FROM EMP;```

---
## Alias
---
-  COLUMN ALIAS: Function to assign an alias (temporary name) to a retrieval target
-  Use an alias to clearly distinguish the retrieved column value when the retrieval target uses an expression or function or when you retrieve multiple columns with similar names
-  Format) SELECT retrieval_target [AS] alias, retrieval_target [AS] alias, ... FROM table_name

```SELECT EMPNO, ENAME, DEPTNO FROM EMP;```

```SELECT EMPNO AS NO, ENAME AS NAME, DEPTNO AS DNO FROM EMP;```

```SELECT EMPNO NO, ENAME NAME, DEPTNO DNO FROM EMP;```

```SELECT EMPNO 사원번호, ENAME 사원이름, DEPTNO 부서번호 FROM EMP;```


-  It is recommended to use an alias when the retrieval target in the SELECT statement uses an expression or function

-  SQL statements are created by combining reserved words (keywords) and user- defined identifiers (identifiers)
-  Identifiers (table names, column names, aliases, etc.) are written using snake_case (words separated by underscores)

-  Rules for writing identifiers (table names, column names, aliases, etc.)
-  1. Created by combining letters, numbers, and special characters (_, $, #) -  Case- insensitive
-  2. Starts with a letter and consists of 1 to 30 characters
-  3. Can use characters other than letters (Korean characters, etc.) -  Not recommended
-  4. Cannot use reserved words as identifiers

-  If you want to use a word that does not conform to the identifier writing rules as an identifier, enclose it in double quotes." -  Not recommended

```SELECT EMPNO, ENAME, SAL*12 FROM EMP;```

- SQL statements are created by combining reserved words (keywords) and user- defined identifiers (identifiers)
- Identifiers (table names, column names, aliases, etc.) are written using snake_case (words separated by underscores)

-  Retrieval targets can be retrieved and displayed separately

```SELECT ENAME, JOB FROM EMP;```



-  Use the || symbol in the retrieval target to combine character values and display the result

```SELECT ENAME||JOB FROM EMP;```


-  Character values in SQL statements are represented using '' (single quotes)

```SELECT ENAME||'님의 업무는 '||JOB||'입니다.' RESULT FROM EMP;```


-  Retrieve the jobs of all employees stored in the EMP table -  Retrieve duplicate column values

```SELECT JOB FROM EMP;```


-  Retrieve the jobs of all employees stored in the EMP table -  Retrieve only unique column values, excluding duplicates
-  DISTINCT: Keyword used to retrieve only unique column values, excluding duplicates, from the retrieval target
-  Format) SELECT DISTINCT column_name, column_name, .. FROM table_name

 ```SELECT DISTINCT JOB FROM EMP;```
 

-  In Oracle, you can use the DISTINCT keyword to specify multiple retrieval targets
-  Retrieve column is not the duplicated
  I apologize for misunderstanding your instructions. Here's the Korean text translated to English, preserving the original format:

```SELECT Distinct JOB, DEPTNO FROM EMP;```

---
## Where
---

-  WHERE: clause is used to filter rows based on a condition.
-  Syntax: SELECT retrieval_target, retrieval_target,... FROM table_name WHERE condition;
-  The condition is an expression that compares column values using comparison operators and comparison values.

-  This query retrieves all employee job titles (JOB) and department numbers (DEPTNO) from the EMP table, ensuring no duplicates exist in the results.

```EMP table:```


-  Stores information about employees in the database.

```SELECT EMPNO, ENAME, JOB, SAL FROM EMP;```


-  This query retrieves all employee details from the EMP table, including employee number (EMPNO), employee name (ENAME), job title (JOB), and salary (SAL).

```SELECT EMPNO, ENAME, JOB, SAL FROM EMP WHERE EMPNO=7698;```


-  This query retrieves details of the employee with employee number 7698 from the EMP table.

```SELECT EMPNO, ENAME, JOB, SAL FROM EMP WHERE ENAME='KING';```


-  This query retrieves details of the employee named 'KING' from the EMP table.
-  Note that character comparisons are case- sensitive.

- base for date -> rr/dd/mm
  
```SELECT EMPNO, ENAME, JOB, SAL, HIREDATE FROM EMP WHERE HIREDATE='81/06/09';```

-  This query retrieves details of employees who were hired on '1981- 06- 09' (format YYYY- MM- DD is also acceptable).

```SELECT EMPNO, ENAME, JOB, SAL FROM EMP WHERE JOB<>'SALESMAN';```


-  This query retrieves details of employees whose job title is not 'SALESMAN'.

```SELECT EMPNO, ENAME, JOB, SAL FROM EMP WHERE SAL>=2000;```


-  This query retrieves details of employees with a salary greater than or equal to 2000.

```SELECT EMPNO, ENAME, JOB, SAL FROM EMP WHERE ENAME<'D';```


-  This query retrieves details of employees whose names begin with letters A, B, or C.

```SELECT EMPNO, ENAME, JOB, SAL, HIREDATE FROM EMP WHERE HIREDATE<'81/05/01';```


-  This query retrieves details of employees who were hired before '1981- 05- 01'.

```SELECT EMPNO, ENAME, JOB, SAL FROM EMP WHERE JOB='SALESMAN' AND SAL>=1500;```


-  This query retrieves details of employees who are SALESMAN and have a salary greater than or equal to 1500.

```SELECT EMPNO, ENAME, JOB, SAL, DEPTNO FROM EMP WHERE JOB='MANAGER' OR DEPTNO=10;```


-  This query retrieves details of employees who are either MANAGER or belong to department number 10.

```SELECT EMPNO, ENAME, JOB, SAL FROM EMP WHERE SAL>=1000 AND SAL<=3000;```


-  This query retrieves details of employees whose salary falls within the range of 1000 to 3000 (inclusive).
-  Alternatively, you can use BETWEEN operator for inclusive range conditions.
-  Syntax: column_name BETWEEN lower_value AND upper_value

```SELECT EMPNO, ENAME, JOB, SAL FROM EMP WHERE JOB='ANALYST' OR JOB='SALESMAN';```


-  This query retrieves details of employees who are either ANALYST or SALESMAN.

```SELECT EMPNO, ENAME, JOB, SAL FROM EMP WHERE JOB IN ('ANALYST','SALESMAN');```


-  This query retrieves details of employees whose job title is included in the list ('ANALYST', 'SALESMAN').

```SELECT EMPNO, ENAME, JOB, SAL FROM EMP WHERE ENAME='ALLEN';```


-  This query retrieves details of the employee named 'ALLEN'.

```SELECT EMPNO, ENAME, JOB, SAL FROM EMP WHERE ENAME>='A' AND ENAME<'B';```


-  This query retrieves details of employees whose names begin with the letter 'A'.

-  Wildcard characters can be used in the condition to match patterns in column values.
-  [%]: Matches any number of characters (including zero).
-  [_] : Matches a single character.
-  When using the '=' operator with wildcard characters, they are treated as literal characters, not patterns.


```SELECT EMPNO, ENAME, JOB, SAL FROM EMP WHERE ENAME='A%';```  -  This will result in an error.


-  To use wildcards for pattern matching, use the LIKE operator.
-  Syntax: column_name LIKE 'pattern_with_wildcard_characters';


```SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,JOB,SAL FROM EMP WHERE ENAME LIKE 'A%';```

- Use LIKE keyword instead of [=] operator when not using search pattern characters in comparison values

```SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,JOB,SAL FROM EMP WHERE ENAME='ALLEN';```

```SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,JOB,SAL FROM EMP WHERE ENAME LIKE 'ALLEN';```


- Search employee number, employee name, job, salary of employees whose name contains A from EMP table

```SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,JOB,SAL FROM EMP WHERE ENAME LIKE '%A%';```

- Search employee number, employee name, job, salary of employees whose second letter of name contains [L] from EMP table

```SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,JOB,SAL FROM EMP WHERE ENAME LIKE '_L%';```

- Insert and save new employee information in EMP table

```INSERT INTO EMP VALUES(9000,'M_BEER','CLERK',7788,'81/12/12',1300,NULL,10);```

```SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE EMPNO=9000;```

```COMMIT;```

- Search employee number, employee name, job, salary of employees whose name contains [_] character from EMP table

```SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,JOB,SAL FROM EMP WHERE ENAME LIKE '%_%';```- Search error: [_] character is compared as search pattern character, not as a general character

- Use ESCAPE keyword to provide characters that cannot be expressed as character values (% or _) as escape characters to compare them as general characters

```SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,JOB,SAL FROM EMP WHERE ENAME LIKE '%\_%' ESCAPE '\';```

- Delete row with employee number 9000 from EMP table

```DELETE FROM EMP WHERE EMPNO=9000;```

```SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE EMPNO=9000;```

```COMMIT;```

- Search employee number, employee name, job, salary of employees whose job is not MANAGER from EMP table

```SELECT EMPNO, ENAME, JOB, SAL FROM EMP WHERE JOB<>'MANAGER';```

- Provide conditional expression that searches rows where the result is FALSE (not TRUE) using NOT keyword
- Format: NOT(condition)

```SELECT EMPNO, ENAME, JOB, SAL FROM EMP WHERE NOT(JOB='MANAGER');```

- Search employee number, employee name, job, salary, commission of all employees from EMP table

```SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,JOB,SAL,COMM FROM EMP;```

- Search employee number, employee name, job, salary, commission of employees who do not have commission from EMP table

```SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,JOB,SAL,COMM FROM EMP WHERE COMM=NULL;```- Search error: NULL is not a value, so it cannot be compared
- Provide operation expression to compare if column value is NULL using IS keyword
- Format: column_name IS NULL or column_name IS NOT NULL

```SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,JOB,SAL,COMM FROM EMP WHERE COMM IS NULL;```

- Search employee number, employee name, job, salary, commission of employees who have commission from EMP table

```SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,JOB,SAL,COMM FROM EMP WHERE COMM IS NOT NULL;```

- ORDER BY: Keyword providing functionality to sort rows by comparing column values of rows

- Format: SELECT search_target,search_target,... FROM table_name [WHERE condition] ORDER BY {column_name|expression|alias|COLUMN_INDEX} {ASC|DESC},{column_name|expression|alias|COLUMN_INDEX} {ASC|DESC},...

- ASC: Sort in ascending order, DESC: Sort in descending order

- If rows provided by ORDER BY keyword have the same column value, they can be sorted by comparing other column values

- Search employee number, employee name, job, salary, department number of all employees stored in EMP table; sorted by the order of insertion

```SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,JOB,SAL,DEPTNO FROM EMP;```

- Search employee number, employee name, job, salary, department number of all employees stored in EMP table; sorted by department number in ascending order

```SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,SAL*12 ANNUAL FROM EMP ORDER BY SAL*12 DESC;```- Sort rows using expression 

```SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,SAL*12 ANNUAL FROM EMP ORDER BY ANNUAL DESC;```- Sort rows using alias
- COLUMN_INDEX: Index sequentially assigned to search targets in SELECT command -  In ORACLE, index is expressed as increasing numerical value starting from 1

```SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,SAL*12 ANNUAL FROM EMP ORDER BY 3 DESC;```- Sort rows using COLUMN_INDEX 

- Search employee number, employee name, job, salary, department number of all employees stored in EMP table; sorted by department number in ascending order and by salary in descending order when department number is the same
