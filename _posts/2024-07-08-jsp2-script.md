## Script ex )counter
Sure, here is the translated version of the JSP document with English comments:

```jsp
<%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html; charset=UTF-8"
    pageEncoding="UTF-8"%>
<%-- Declaration: Provides an area to declare fields or methods --%>
<%-- => Executed when the servlet object is created --%>    
<%!
    // Field to store values needed by the servlet object
    // => Field is automatically destroyed when the servlet object is removed from memory
    int count = 0;
%>    
<%-- Scriptlet: Provides an area to write commands for processing requests --%>
<%-- => Executed by the client's request as commands of the request handling method --%>    
<%
    // Local variable created in the request handling method
    // => Local variable is automatically destroyed when the method in which it is declared ends
    // int count = 0;

    count++;
%>
