- Use the TO_DATE function to convert the character value to a date value for date calculations

``` SELECT SYSDATE-TO_DATE('2000-01-01') FROM DUAL; ``` 

``` SELECT CEIL(SYSDATE-TO_DATE('2000-01-01'))||'days' AS "Days lived until today" FROM DUAL; ```

- General functions: Functions that convert and return the value passed as a parameter to a changed value if a certain condition is true (TRUE)

- NVL(original_value, replacement_value): Function that converts and returns the replacement value if the original value is NULL

``` SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,SAL*12 ANNUAL FROM EMP; ``` 

- Retrieve employee number, employee name, and annual salary ((salary+commission)*12) for all employees stored in the EMP table
- If the commission (COMM column value) is NULL, the calculation is not possible, and the result will be NULL

``` SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,(SAL+COMM)*12 ANNUAL FROM EMP; ``` - Search error

- Use the NVL function to return [0] if the commission (COMM column value) is NULL and perform the calculation

``` SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,(SAL+NVL(COMM,0))*12 ANNUAL FROM EMP; ``` 

- NVL2(original_value, replacement_value1, replacement_value2): Function that converts and returns replacement_value1 if the original_value is not NULL and converts and returns replacement_value2 if the original_value is NULL

- DECODE(original_value, compare_value1, replacement_value1, compare_value2, replacement_value2,...[, default_value]): Function that compares the original_value with the compare_values in sequence and converts and returns the replacement_value if the original_value matches the compare_value
- If the original_value does not match any compare_values, it is converted to and returns the default_value, but if the default_value is omitted, it returns NULL

- Retrieve employee number, employee name, job, salary, and actual salary by job (actual salary to be paid based on the job of the employee) for all employees stored in the EMP table

## GroupFunction
---

- Group functions: Functions that process multiple values passed as parameters and return the result

- If the group function is used with other search targets and the number of returned values from the group function is different from the number of rows of the search target, an error occurs

``` SELECT COUNT(EMPNO),EMPNO FROM EMP; ``` - Error occurs

- Since NULL is not a value, group functions return the result excluding NULL

``` SELECT COUNT(EMPNO),COUNT(COMM) FROM EMP; ```

``` SELECT AVG(COMM) FROM EMP; ``` - Search error

``` SELECT AVG(NVL(COMM,0)) FROM EMP; ``` 

``` SELECT CEIL(AVG(NVL(COMM,0))) "Average Commission" FROM EMP; ```

``` SELECT COUNT(*) FROM EMP WHERE DEPTNO=20; ``` - Search the number of employees working in department 20

``` SELECT COUNT(*) FROM EMP WHERE DEPTNO=30; ``` - Search the number of employees working in department 30

- GROUP BY: Keyword that provides the functionality to divide multiple groups for searching by distinguishing rows by column values when using group functions in the search target
- If the column values of rows are the same, they are grouped together and searched - the number of search rows is the same as the number of groups
- Format) ``` SELECT group_function(column_name)[, search_target, ...] FROM table_name [WHERE condition]
     GROUP BY {column_name|expression|function}, {column_name|expression|function}, ...  ORDER BY {column_name|expression|function|alias|COLUMN_INDEX} {ASC|DESC}, ...

- Group the rows (employee information) stored in the EMP table by department number and search the number of employees

``` SELECT JOB,COUNT(*) CNT,SUM(SAL) SUM_SAL,CEIL(AVG(SAL)) AVG_SAL FROM EMP GROUP BY JOB; ``` 

``` SELECT JOB,COUNT(*) CNT,SUM(SAL) SUM_SAL,CEIL(AVG(SAL)) AVG_SAL FROM EMP GROUP BY JOB ORDER BY CNT; ``` 

- Group employees by job, excluding those whose job is PRESIDENT, and search the total salary

``` SELECT JOB,SUM(SAL) FROM EMP WHERE JOB<>'PRESIDENT' GROUP BY JOB; ``` 

- HAVING: Keyword that provides the functionality to search only groups where the condition is true (TRUE) from the groups created by the GROUP BY keyword
- Use the column name or group function used as the search target in the ``` SELECT keyword to write the condition of the HAVING keyword
- Format) ``` SELECT group_function(column_name)[, search_target, ...] FROM table_name [WHERE condition]
    GROUP BY {column_name|expression|function}, {column_name|expression|function}, ... HAVING group_condition     ORDER BY {column_name|expression|function|alias|COLUMN_INDEX} {ASC|DESC}, ...

- Group employees by job, excluding those whose job is PRESIDENT, and search the total salary

``` SELECT JOB,SUM(SAL) FROM EMP GROUP BY JOB HAVING JOB<>'PRESIDENT'; ``` 

- Group all employees stored in the EMP table by department number and search the department number and total salary for departments with a total salary of 9000 or more

``` SELECT DEPTNO,SUM(SAL) FROM EMP GROUP BY DEPTNO HAVING SUM(SAL)>=9000; ```
