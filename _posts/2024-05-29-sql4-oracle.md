# Table Join
---

- Table Join: Function to search for desired column values by combining rows from two or more tables

- Retrieve employee number, employee name, salary, and department number for all employees stored in the EMP table

``` SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,SAL,DEPTNO FROM EMP;```

- Retrieve department number, department name, and department location for all departments stored in the DEPT table

``` SELECT DEPTNO,DNAME,LOC FROM DEPT;```

- Retrieve employee number, employee name, salary, department name, and department location for all employees from the EMP and DEPT tables
- When combining rows from two or more tables, it is essential to provide a condition to combine the rows
- Cartesian Product: Search result combining all rows from two or more tables without any join condition

``` SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,SAL,DNAME,LOC FROM EMP,DEPT;``` - Search error

---
## Equi Join
---

- Equi Join: Searches only the rows where the result of the join condition using the = operator is true (TRUE)
- Does not search rows where the join condition result is false (FALSE)

- Retrieve employee number, employee name, salary, department name, and department location for all employees from the EMP and DEPT tables
- Join condition: Combine and search only the rows where the DEPTNO column value of the EMP table matches the DEPTNO column value of the DEPT table
- Write the join condition as the condition of the WHERE keyword
- If the tables to be joined have columns with the same name, use the format [table_name.column_name]

``` SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,SAL,DNAME,LOC FROM EMP,DEPT WHERE EMP.DEPTNO=DEPT.DEPTNO;```

- Retrieve employee number, employee name, salary, department number, department name, and department location for all employees from the EMP and DEPT tables
- Join condition: Combine and search only the rows where the DEPTNO column value of the EMP table matches the DEPTNO column value of the DEPT table

``` SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,SAL,EMP.DEPTNO,DNAME,LOC FROM EMP,DEPT WHERE EMP.DEPTNO=DEPT.DEPTNO;```

``` SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,SAL,DEPT.DEPTNO,DNAME,LOC FROM EMP,DEPT WHERE EMP.DEPTNO=DEPT.DEPTNO;```

- When searching for columns with the same name in the search target of a table join, the name of the second column is automatically changed and searched

``` SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,SAL,EMP.DEPTNO,DEPT.DEPTNO,DNAME,LOC FROM EMP,DEPT WHERE EMP.DEPTNO=DEPT.DEPTNO;```

- When searching for columns with the same name in the search target of a table join, it is recommended to set an alias for the columns

``` SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,SAL,EMP.DEPTNO EMP_DEPTNO,DEPT.DEPTNO DEPT_DEPTNO,DNAME,LOC FROM EMP,DEPT WHERE EMP.DEPTNO=DEPT.DEPTNO;```
  
---
## Table Alias
---

- TABLE ALIAS: Function to provide temporary aliases for search tables
- Format:  SELECT search target,... FROM table_name alias, table_name alias,...
- When joining tables, use table aliases to simplify the writing of table names or to express one table as multiple tables for searching
- Using the table name instead of the alias after giving an alias to the table will result in an error

``` SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,SAL,E.DEPTNO EMP_DEPTNO,D.DEPTNO DEPT_DEPTNO,DNAME,LOC FROM EMP E,DEPT D WHERE E.DEPTNO=D.DEPTNO;```

- NON-EQUI JOIN: Searches only the rows where the result of the join condition using operators other than = is true (TRUE)

- Retrieve employee number, employee name, and salary for all employees stored in the EMP table

``` SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,SAL FROM EMP;```

- Retrieve grade number, minimum salary, and maximum salary for all salary grades stored in the SALGRADE table
``` SELECT GRADE,LOSAL,HISAL FROM SALGRADE;```

- Retrieve employee number, employee name, salary, and grade number for all employees from the EMP and SALGRADE tables
- Join condition: Combine and search only the rows where the employee's salary falls within the range from minimum salary to maximum salary

``` SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,SAL,GRADE FROM EMP,SALGRADE WHERE SAL>=LOSAL AND SAL<=HISAL;```

``` SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,SAL,GRADE FROM EMP,SALGRADE WHERE SAL BETWEEN LOSAL AND HISAL;```

---
## Outer Join
---

- OUTER JOIN: Searches and combines rows that match the join condition and combines rows that do not match the join condition with NULL
- Using the (+) symbol in the join condition for the table allows the rows that do not match the join condition to be combined with NULL and searched

- Retrieve all department numbers stored in the EMP table, excluding duplicate department numbers and only searching for unique department numbers

``` SELECT DISTINCT DEPTNO FROM EMP;```- Search result: 10, 20, 30

- Retrieve department number, department name, and department location for all departments stored in the DEPT table

``` SELECT DEPTNO,DNAME,LOC FROM DEPT;```


- Retrieve employee number, employee name, salary, department name, and department location for all employees from the EMP and DEPT tables
- Join condition: Combine and search only the rows where the DEPTNO column value of the EMP table matches the DEPTNO column value of the DEPT table
- Since there are no employees working in department 40, the department name and location for department 40 are not searched

``` SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,SAL,DNAME,LOC FROM EMP,DEPT WHERE EMP.DEPTNO=DEPT.DEPTNO;```

- Retrieve employee number, employee name, salary, department name, and department location for all employees from the EMP and DEPT tables
- Join condition: Combine and search the rows where the DEPTNO column value of the EMP table matches the DEPTNO column value of the DEPT table, but also search the department name and location of departments without employees using outer join

``` SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,SAL,DNAME,LOC FROM EMP,DEPT WHERE EMP.DEPTNO(+)=DEPT.DEPTNO;```

---
## Self Join
---

- SELF JOIN: Create two tables by giving different aliases to one table and combine rows from these two tables for searching
- Since all column names of the table are the same, use table aliases to distinguish columns when searching and use column aliases instead of column names when searching

- Retrieve employee number, employee name, and manager number (manager's employee number) for all employees stored in the EMP table

``` SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,MGR FROM EMP;```

- Retrieve employee number, employee name, manager number (manager's employee number), and manager name (manager's employee name) for all employees stored in the EMP table
- Join condition: Combine and search only the rows where the MGR column value of the EMP table (WORKER) matches the EMPNO column value of the EMP table (MANAGER)

``` SELECT WORKER.EMPNO WORKER_EMPNO,WORKER.ENAME WORKER_ENAME,WORKER.MGR WORKER_MGR,MANAGER.ENAME MANAGER_ENAME FROM EMP WORKER,EMP MANAGER WHERE WORKER.MGR=MANAGER.EMPNO;```- Search error

- Join condition: Combine and search the rows where the MGR column value of the EMP table (WORKER) matches the EMPNO column value of the EMP table (MANAGER), but combine the employee's name with NULL for employees without managers

``` SELECT WORKER.EMPNO WORKER_EMPNO,WORKER.ENAME WORKER_ENAME,WORKER.MGR WORKER_MGR,MANAGER.ENAME MANAGER_ENAME FROM EMP WORKER,EMP MANAGER WHERE WORKER.MGR=MANAGER.EMPNO(+);```

- Search for employee numbers, employee names, salaries, department names, and department locations of employees working in the department named SALES from the EMP and DEPT tables
- Join condition: Combine rows where the DEPTNO column values in the EMP table and the DEPTNO column values in the DEPT table are equal
``` SELECT EMPNO, ENAME, SAL, DNAME, LOC FROM EMP, DEPT WHERE EMP.DEPTNO = DEPT.DEPTNO AND DNAME = 'SALES';```

- The standard SQL adopted in 1999 (ANSI-SQL) provides the JOIN keyword to combine and search rows from tables

---
## Cross Join
---

- CROSS JOIN: Cross-join all rows of the combined tables - join condition omitted
- Format: ``` SELECT search_target,... FROM table_name1 CROSS JOIN table_name2

``` SELECT EMPNO, ENAME, SAL, DNAME, LOC FROM EMP CROSS JOIN DEPT;```

---
## Natural Join
---

- NATURAL JOIN: If there is only one column with the same name in the combined tables, combine and search only the rows where the column values are equal - join condition omitted
- Format: ``` SELECT search_target,... FROM table_name1 NATURAL JOIN table_name2
- Combine and search only the rows where the DEPTNO column values in the EMP table and the DEPTNO column values in the DEPT table are equal

``` SELECT EMPNO, ENAME, SAL, DNAME, LOC FROM EMP NATURAL JOIN DEPT;```

- If you use NATURAL JOIN, you can search without distinguishing the table when searching for column values with the same column name in the combined tables

``` SELECT EMPNO, ENAME, SAL, DEPTNO, DNAME, LOC FROM EMP NATURAL JOIN DEPT;```

- JOIN USING: If there are multiple columns with the same name in the combined tables, combine and search only the rows where the column values of the desired column are equal - join condition omitted
- Format: ``` SELECT search_target,... FROM table_name1 JOIN table_name2 USING(column_name)
- Combine and search only the rows where the DEPTNO column values in the EMP table and the DEPTNO column values in the DEPT table are equal

``` SELECT EMPNO, ENAME, SAL, DNAME, LOC FROM EMP JOIN DEPT USING(DEPTNO);```

- When searching for column values with the column name set using the USING keyword, you can search without distinguishing the table

``` SELECT EMPNO, ENAME, SAL, DEPTNO, DNAME, LOC FROM EMP JOIN DEPT USING(DEPTNO);```

---
## Inner Join
---

- INNER JOIN: Provide join conditions and combine and search only the rows where the join condition is true - combine and search rows in a 1:1 relationship using join conditions
- Format: ``` SELECT search_target,... FROM table_name1 [INNER] JOIN table_name2 ON join_condition

- Search for employee numbers, employee names, salaries, department names, and department locations of all employees from the EMP and DEPT tables
- Join condition: Combine and search only the rows where the DEPTNO column values in the EMP table and the DEPTNO column values in the DEPT table are equal

``` SELECT EMPNO, ENAME, SAL, DNAME, LOC FROM EMP JOIN DEPT ON EMP.DEPTNO = DEPT.DEPTNO;```

- Search for employee numbers, employee names, salaries, and grade numbers of all employees from the EMP and SALGRADE tables
- Join condition: Combine and search only the rows where the employee's salary is within the range of the minimum salary to the maximum salary

``` SELECT EMPNO, ENAME, SAL, GRADE FROM EMP JOIN SALGRADE ON SAL BETWEEN LOSAL AND HISAL;```

- Search for employee numbers, employee names, salaries, grade numbers, department names, and department locations of all employees from the EMP, DEPT, and SALGRADE tables
- Join condition-1: Combine and search only the rows where the DEPTNO column values in the EMP table and the DEPTNO column values in the DEPT table are equal
- Join condition-2: Combine and search only the rows where the employee's salary is within the range of the minimum salary to the maximum salary

``` SELECT EMPNO, ENAME, SAL, GRADE, DNAME, LOC FROM EMP JOIN DEPT ON EMP.DEPTNO = DEPT.DEPTNO JOIN SALGRADE ON SAL BETWEEN LOSAL AND HISAL;```

---
## Outer Join
---

- OUTER JOIN: Provide join conditions and combine and search the rows where the join condition is true, and combine and search the rows where the join condition is false with NULL
- Combine and search rows in a 1:N (0 or more) relationship using join conditions
- Format: ``` SELECT search_target,... FROM table_name1 {LEFT|RIGHT|FULL} [OUTER] JOIN table_name2 ON join_condition
- LEFT OUTER JOIN: All rows of the table located to the left of the JOIN keyword are processed unconditionally
- RIGHT OUTER JOIN: All rows of the table located to the right of the JOIN keyword are processed unconditionally
- FULL OUTER JOIN: All rows of both tables located on either side of the JOIN keyword are processed unconditionally

- Search for employee numbers, employee names, salaries, department names, and department locations of all employees from the EMP and DEPT tables
- Join condition: Combine and search only the rows where the DEPTNO column values in the EMP table and the DEPTNO column values in the DEPT table are equal
- Since there are no employees working in department 40, department name and department location for department 40 are not searched

``` SELECT EMPNO, ENAME, SAL, DNAME, LOC FROM EMP JOIN DEPT ON EMP.DEPTNO = DEPT.DEPTNO;```

- Search for employee numbers, employee names, salaries, department names, and department locations of all employees from the EMP and DEPT tables
- Join condition: Combine and search the rows where the DEPTNO column values in the EMP table and the DEPTNO column values in the DEPT table are equal, and if there is no employee information combined with the department information stored in the DEPT table, combine and search with NULL - search for department name and department location for department 40

``` SELECT EMPNO, ENAME, SAL, DNAME, LOC FROM EMP RIGHT JOIN DEPT ON EMP.DEPTNO = DEPT.DEPTNO;```

``` SELECT EMPNO, ENAME, SAL, DNAME, LOC FROM EMP FULL JOIN DEPT ON EMP.DEPTNO = DEPT.DEPTNO;```

- Search for the employee number, employee name, salary, department name, and location of employees working in the department named SALES from the EMP and DEPT tables    
- Join condition: Only join rows where the DEPTNO column value in the EMP table matches the DEPTNO column value in the DEPT table

``` SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,SAL,DNAME,LOC FROM EMP JOIN DEPT ON EMP.DEPTNO=DEPT.DEPTNO WHERE DNAME='SALES';```

---
## Subquery
---

- Subquery: A SELECT command that is included and executed within an SQL command
- Use a subquery to get results from multiple SQL command executions with a single SQL command execution

- A SELECT command (MAINQUERY) that includes and executes a SELECT command (SUBQUERY)
- The subquery command is executed first, and the result is used in the main query command to provide the search results
- In the ``` SELECT command (MAINQUERY), subqueries are written in parentheses in the FROM, WHERE, and HAVING keywords

- Search for the employee number, employee name, and salary of employees who earn more than the employee named SCOTT in the EMP table
- Use the ``` SELECT command twice to get the desired result

``` SELECT SAL FROM EMP WHERE ENAME='SCOTT';```- Result: 3000

``` SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,SAL FROM EMP WHERE SAL>3000;```

- Using a subquery, you can get the desired result with a single SELECT command
- Use the result of the subquery in place of the comparison value in the WHERE clause to search for rows in the table
- When using a subquery instead of a comparison value in the condition, write the ``` SELECT command to search for the value of a single row (SINGLE-ROW) and single column (SINGLE-COLUMN)

``` SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,SAL FROM EMP WHERE SAL>(SELECT SAL FROM EMP WHERE ENAME='SCOTT');```

- Search for the employee number, employee name, job, and salary of employees who have the same job as the employee with employee number 7844 in the EMP table

``` SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,JOB,SAL FROM EMP WHERE JOB=(SELECT JOB FROM EMP WHERE EMPNO=7844) AND EMPNO<>7844;```

- Search for the employee number, employee name, job, and salary of employees who have the same job as the employee with employee number 7521 and earn more than the employee with employee number 7844 in the EMP table

``` SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,JOB,SAL FROM EMP WHERE JOB=(SELECT JOB FROM EMP WHERE EMPNO=7521) AND EMPNO<>7521 AND SAL>(SELECT SAL FROM EMP WHERE EMPNO=7844);```

- Search for the employee number, employee name, job, and salary of employees working in the department named SALES in the EMP table

``` SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,JOB,SAL FROM EMP JOIN DEPT ON EMP.DEPTNO=DEPT.DEPTNO WHERE DNAME='SALES';```- Table join

``` SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,JOB,SAL FROM EMP WHERE DEPTNO=(SELECT DEPTNO FROM DEPT WHERE DNAME='SALES');```- Subquery 

- Search for the employee number, employee name, job, and salary of the employee who received the lowest salary in the EMP table

``` SELECT MIN(SAL) FROM EMP;```- Result: 800

``` SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,JOB,SAL FROM EMP WHERE SAL=800;```

- Search using a subquery

``` SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,JOB,SAL FROM EMP WHERE SAL=(SELECT MIN(SAL) FROM EMP);```

- Search for the employee number, employee name, job, and salary of the employee who received the highest salary in the EMP table

``` SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,JOB,SAL FROM EMP WHERE SAL=(SELECT MAX(SAL) FROM EMP);```

- Search for the employee number, employee name, job, and salary of the employee who received the lowest salary among employees working in the department named SALES in the EMP table
- Oracle allows subqueries within subqueries

``` SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,JOB,SAL FROM EMP WHERE DEPTNO=(SELECT DEPTNO FROM DEPT WHERE DNAME='SALES') AND SAL=(SELECT MIN(SAL) FROM EMP WHERE DEPTNO=(SELECT DEPTNO FROM DEPT WHERE DNAME='SALES'));```
    
- Group all employees in the EMP table by department number, then search for the department number and average salary of the department with the highest average salary
- Use a subquery in the condition of the HAVING clause to receive and search for the result of the subquery

``` SELECT DEPTNO,CEIL(AVG(SAL)) FROM EMP GROUP BY DEPTNO HAVING AVG(SAL)=( SELECT MAX(AVG(SAL)) FROM EMP GROUP BY DEPTNO);```

- Search for the employee number, employee name, salary, and department number of employees who receive the lowest salary in each department after grouping all employees in the EMP table by department number    
- When using a subquery instead of the comparison value in the condition, if the result of the subquery is a multi-row single-column value, 
- an error occurs if the condition uses the = operator

``` SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,SAL,DEPTNO FROM EMP WHERE SAL=( SELECT MIN(SAL) FROM EMP GROUP BY DEPTNO);```- Error

- When using a subquery instead of the comparison value in the condition, if the result of the subquery is a multi-row single-column value,
- using the IN keyword instead of the = operator in the condition allows searching
- Abnormal results occur as employees who do not receive the lowest salary in their department can also be searched

``` SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,SAL,DEPTNO FROM EMP WHERE SAL IN(SELECT MIN(SAL) FROM EMP GROUP BY DEPTNO);```- Search error

- In a subquery, it is possible to provide the column values of the main query's table

``` SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,SAL,DEPTNO FROM EMP E1 WHERE SAL IN (SELECT MIN(SAL) FROM EMP E2 WHERE E1.DEPTNO=E2.DEPTNO GROUP BY DEPTNO);```

- When using a subquery instead of the comparison value in the condition, if the result of the subquery is a multi-row single-column value,
- use the ANY or ALL keyword before the subquery to search using the > or < operators

- Search for the employee number, employee name, salary, and department number of employees whose salary is less than any employee working in department number 10 in the EMP table

``` SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,SAL,DEPTNO FROM EMP WHERE SAL<ANY(SELECT SAL FROM EMP WHERE DEPTNO=10) AND DEPTNO<>10;```

- Search for the employee number, employee name, salary, and department number of employees whose salary is less than all employees working in department number 10 in the EMP table

``` SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,SAL,DEPTNO FROM EMP WHERE SAL<ALL( SELECT SAL FROM EMP WHERE DEPTNO=10);```

- Search for the employee number, employee name, salary, and department number of employees whose salary is more than any employee working in department number 20 in the EMP table

``` SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,SAL,DEPTNO FROM EMP WHERE SAL>ANY( SELECT SAL FROM EMP WHERE DEPTNO=20) AND DEPTNO<>20;```

- Search for the employee number, employee name, salary, and department number of employees whose salary is more than all employees working in department number 20 in the EMP table

``` SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,SAL,DEPTNO FROM EMP WHERE SAL>ALL(SELECT SAL FROM EMP WHERE DEPTNO=20);```

- Instead of using the ANY or ALL keyword for multi-row single-column subqueries with > or < operators,
- it is recommended to use single-row single-column subqueries with the MIN or MAX function

- Search for the employee number, employee name, salary, and department number of employees whose salary is less than any employee working in department number 10 in the EMP table
- Use column name<(single-row subquery - MAX function) instead of column name<ANY(multi-row subquery)

``` SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,SAL,DEPTNO FROM EMP WHERE SAL<(SELECT MAX(SAL) FROM EMP WHERE DEPTNO=10) AND DEPTNO<>10;```

- Search for the employee number, employee name, salary, and department number of employees whose salary is less than all employees working in department number 10 in the EMP table
- Use column name<(single-row subquery - MIN function) instead of column name<ALL(multi-row subquery)

``` SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,SAL,DEPTNO FROM EMP WHERE SAL<(SELECT MIN(SAL) FROM EMP WHERE DEPTNO=10);```

- Search for the employee number, employee name, salary, and department number of employees whose salary is more than any employee working in department number 20 in the EMP table
- Use column name>(single-row subquery - MIN function) instead of column name>ANY(multi-row subquery)

``` SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,SAL,DEPTNO FROM EMP WHERE SAL>(SELECT MIN(SAL) FROM EMP WHERE DEPTNO=20) AND DEPTNO<>20;```

- Search for the employee number, employee name, salary, and department number of employees whose salary is more than all employees working in department number 20 in the EMP table
- Use column name>(single-row subquery - MAX function) instead of column name>ALL(multi-row subquery)

``` SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,SAL,DEPTNO FROM EMP WHERE SAL>(SELECT MAX(SAL) FROM EMP WHERE DEPTNO=20);```

- Search for the employee number, employee name, manager number, job, and salary of employees whose manager number and job are the same as those of the employee named ALLEN in the EMP table

``` SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,MGR,JOB,SAL FROM EMP WHERE MGR=( SELECT MGR FROM EMP WHERE ENAME='ALLEN')
    AND JOB=(``` SELECT JOB FROM EMP WHERE ENAME='ALLEN') AND ENAME<>'ALLEN';```

- Subqueries that search for multi-column values in single rows can list the comparison column values within ()    

``` SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,MGR,JOB,SAL FROM EMP WHERE (MGR,JOB)=(SELECT MGR,JOB FROM EMP 
    WHERE ENAME='ALLEN') AND ENAME<>'ALLEN';```
