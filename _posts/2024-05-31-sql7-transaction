--TCL (TRANSACTION CONTROL LANGUAGE): Transaction Control Language
--SQL commands that apply the stored SQL commands in a transaction to the actual table or cancel them without applying to the table

--Transaction (TRANSACTION): A logical unit of work in a client connection environment (session - SESSION) where SQL commands are written and sent to the connected DBMS server
--The DBMS server receiving the SQL commands stores them in the transaction and uses them for querying without immediately applying them to the actual table

--To apply the SQL commands stored in the transaction to the actual table, commit (COMMIT) is needed - the transaction is initialized after commit
--1. Automatic commit occurs if the current session is properly disconnected from the DBMS server
--2. Automatic commit occurs if a DDL command or DCL command is written and sent to the DBMS server in the current session - Only DML commands are stored in the transaction
--3. DML commands stored in the DBMS server's transaction are committed only when the COMMIT command is sent

--To clear the SQL commands stored in the transaction without applying them to the actual table, rollback (ROLLBACK) is needed
--1. Automatic rollback occurs if the current session is abnormally disconnected from the DBMS server
--2. DML commands stored in the DBMS server's transaction are rolled back only when the ROLLBACK command is sent

--Delete department information with department number 50 from the DEPT table

SELECT * FROM DEPT;

--When the DELETE command is sent to the DBMS server, the DELETE command is stored in the transaction without deleting the row from the table

DELETE FROM DEPT WHERE DEPTNO=50;

--Executing the SELECT command will provide the query results with the DELETE command stored in the transaction applied to the table rows

SELECT * FROM DEPT;

--Use the ROLLBACK command to perform a rollback

ROLLBACK;

SELECT * FROM DEPT;

--Delete department information with department number 50 from the DEPT table

DELETE FROM DEPT WHERE DEPTNO=50;--The DELETE command is stored in the transaction

--Use the COMMIT command to perform a commit - the transaction is initialized after commit

COMMIT;--The DELETE command stored in the transaction is applied to the actual table

SELECT * FROM DEPT;
