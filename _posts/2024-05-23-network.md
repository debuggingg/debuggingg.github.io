### Summary

These commands are essential for network diagnostics and management. They help in viewing network configurations, managing routing tables, resolving domain names, testing connectivity, and monitoring network connections. Here’s a quick overview of what each command does:

* ipconfig / ipconfig /all: Display basic and detailed network configuration.
* ifconfig: Mac equivalent for network configuration.
* route print: Show the routing table.
* route delete/add/change: Manage routes in the routing table.
* nslookup: Query DNS for domain-to-IP mapping.
* ping: Test connectivity to domains or IP addresses.
* netstat -na: View active network connections and interface states.


#### **What is a Socket?**


* Think of a socket as a tool that lets your computer talk to another computer (the server) over the internet, like making a phone call.

#### How Does a Client Connect to a Server?

* Client Needs Two Things:
    1. Server's IP Address: This is like the server’s phone number.
    2. Port Number: This is like an extension number on the server's phone.


#### Creating a Socket:

* The client creates a socket using the server's IP address and port number. It’s like dialing the server's phone number and extension to start a call.


#### Server Accepting Connections:

* The server has several ports open, ready to listen for incoming connections. Imagine these ports as different phone lines waiting for calls.
* When the server receives a connection request (a call) on a port, it uses the accept method to answer the call.
* The accept method creates a new socket for this connection, similar to picking up the phone to start a conversation.


#### Connecting Sockets:

* The server's new socket connects to the client’s socket.
* This connection creates a communication stream between the client and server, allowing them to send messages back and forth.


#### Communication:

* Once the connection is established, the client and server can exchange information through the stream created by the sockets.
* It’s like having a phone conversation where both parties can speak and listen.


#### Server Handling Multiple Clients:

* The server can handle multiple clients by continuously using the accept method to answer new calls. This is done in a loop, so the server is always ready to accept new connections.


---

### Summary
#### Client Side:

1. Create a socket with the server's IP address and port number.
2. Use this socket to connect to the server.

#### Server Side:

1. Listen for incoming connections on a specific port.
2. Use accept to create a new socket for each incoming connection.
3. Connect the new socket to the client’s socket.
4. Use streams to communicate between the client and server.
5. Keep accepting new connections using a loop.

---

By using sockets, clients and servers can talk to each other over the internet. The server can handle multiple clients by continuously accepting new connections and setting up individual communication streams for each client, just like managing multiple phone calls at once.

### **Java How to get MyComputer Information - Class  InetAddressApp**

### Explanation


1. Getting the Current Computer's Information
    * InetAddress.getLocalHost(): This gets the network information (IP address and hostname) of the computer you're using.
    * myComputer.toString(): Prints the full network information as a string.
    * myComputer.getHostName(): Prints the hostname (name of your computer).
    * myComputer.getHostAddress(): Prints the IP address of your computer.
2. Getting the IP Address of a Specific Website
    * InetAddress.getByName("www.itwill.xyz"): This gets the IP address of the website "[www.itwill.xyz](http://www.itwill.xyz/)".
    * itwill.getHostAddress(): Prints the IP address of "[www.itwill.xyz](http://www.itwill.xyz/)".
3. Getting All IP Addresses of a Specific Website
    * InetAddress.getAllByName("www.naver.com"): This gets all the IP addresses associated with the website "[www.naver.com](http://www.naver.com/)".
    * The for loop goes through each IP address and prints it.

Code :
~~~
public class InetAddressApp {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws UnknownHostException {

        // Get the network information of the current computer

        InetAddress myComputer = InetAddress.getLocalHost();

        // Print the network information of the current computer

        System.out.println("My Computer: " + myComputer);

        System.out.println("Hostname: " + myComputer.getHostName());

        System.out.println("IP Address: " + myComputer.getHostAddress());

        

        // Get the IP address of a specific website (www.itwill.xyz)

        InetAddress itwill = InetAddress.getByName("www.itwill.xyz");

        System.out.println("IP Address of www.itwill.xyz: " + itwill.getHostAddress());

        // Get all IP addresses of a specific website (www.naver.com)

        InetAddress[] naverAddresses = InetAddress.getAllByName("www.naver.com");

        for (InetAddress address : naverAddresses) {

            System.out.println("IP Address of www.naver.com: " + address.getHostAddress());

**Server/Client Example  - TimeServerApp, TimeClientApp**

TCP Network Program: TimeServerApp

This program is an example of a TCP network application where a server and a client exchange data. When a client connects to the server, the server sends the current date and time to the client. This is also known as an NTP (Network Time Protocol) server.

**Server **

1.ServerSocket Class
~~~
ServerSocket ntpServer=null;
~~~
   *  Used to create server applications.
    * It opens a port for clients to connect to.

2.Creating the Server Socket
~~~
ServerSocket ntpServer = new ServerSocket(2000);
~~~
   *  Creates a ServerSocket object on port 2000.
    * Throws IOException if the port is already in use by another network application.

3.Waiting for Client Connections

while (true) {
~~~
    Socket socket = ntpServer.accept();
    System.out.println("socket = " + socket);
~~~
  *   Uses an infinite loop to wait for multiple client connections.
    * ServerSocket.accept() method waits until a client connects, then returns a Socket object representing the connection.

4.Sending Data to Client

~~~ 
    OutputStream outputStream = socket.getOutputStream();
    ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(outputStream);
    out.writeObject(new Date());
~~~
   *  Retrieves an OutputStream object to send data to the client.
    * Uses ObjectOutputStream to send a Date object containing the current date and time to the client.

5.Logging - this is just for Server , How many download(conneting my server )

    System.out.println("[Info] Provided date and time to client [" + socket.getInetAddress().getHostAddress() + "].");

* Logs a message indicating that the date and time have been provided to the client.

6.Closing the Client Connection
~~~
socket.close();
~~~

* Closes the connection with the client.

7.Exception Handling
    * If a network error occurs, prints an error message.
    * In the finally block, closes the ServerSocket object to shut down the server and disconnect all clients.


### **Full Code**
~~~
public class TimeServerApp {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        ServerSocket ntpServer = null;

        try {

            ntpServer = new ServerSocket(2000);

            System.out.println("[Message] NTP Server Running...");

            while (true) {

                Socket socket = ntpServer.accept();

                System.out.println("socket = " + socket);

                OutputStream outputStream = socket.getOutputStream();

                ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(outputStream);

                out.writeObject(new Date());

                System.out.println("[Info] Provided date and time to client [" + socket.getInetAddress().getHostAddress() + "].");

                socket.close();

            }

        } catch (IOException e) {

            System.out.println("[Error] A network error occurred.");

        } finally {

            try {

                if (ntpServer != null) ntpServer.close();

            } catch (IOException e) {

                e.printStackTrace();

            }

        }

    }

}

**Summary of Server side **

This program is a simple NTP server that provides the current date and time to clients as they connect. The server runs indefinitely, waiting for client connections, and upon connection, it sends the current date and time, then closes the connection. The server uses an infinite loop to always be ready for new client connections.

**Client**

This program is an example of a TCP client application that connects to an NTP server to receive and display the current date and time sent by the server.

1.Socket Class
    * Used to create objects that store connection information in TCP programs.
    * The Socket constructor takes two parameters: the server's name or IP address (host) and the port number (port) that the server has activated.

2.Creating the Client Socket
~~~
Socket socket = new Socket("192.168.13.6", 2000);
~~~
   *  Creates a Socket object to connect to the server at IP address 192.168.13.6 on port 2000.
    * Throws UnknownHostException if the host cannot be found, and IOException if there is a network error.
    * When connected, input and output streams are automatically created within the Socket object to send and receive data.

3.Receiving Data from the Server
~~~
InputStream inputStream = socket.getInputStream();
ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(inputStream);
~~~
  *   Retrieves an InputStream from the Socket object to receive raw data from the server.
    * Wraps the InputStream in an ObjectInputStream to receive objects (in this case, a Date object).

4.Reading the Date Object
~~~
Date date = (Date) in.readObject();
~~~
   *  Reads the Date object sent by the server using the ObjectInputStream.
    * The readObject() method waits if no object is available until one is sent by the server.

5.Displaying the Date and Time

System.out.println("[Result] Date and Time from Server: " 
~~~
   	  new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy년 MM월 dd일 HH시 mm분 ss초").format(date));
~~~
  * Formats and prints the received Date object using SimpleDateFormat.

6.Closing the Connection
~~~
socket.close();
~~~
* Closes the connection with the server.

Exception Handling



* Handles exceptions for unknown host and network errors, printing appropriate error messages.


### Full Code

public class TimeClientApp {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws ClassNotFoundException {

        try {

            Socket socket = new Socket("192.168.13.6", 2000);

            InputStream inputStream = socket.getInputStream();

            ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(inputStream);

            Date date = (Date) in.readObject();

            System.out.println("[Result] Date and Time from Server: "

                + new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy년 MM월 dd일 HH시 mm분 ss초").format(date));

            socket.close();

        } catch (UnknownHostException e) {

            System.out.println("[Error] Server not found.");

        } catch (IOException e) {

            System.out.println("[Error] Unable to connect to the server.");

        }

    }

}

This program connects to an NTP server, receives the current date and time, and displays it in a formatted string. It handles network errors gracefully and ensures that the connection is properly closed after the data is received.

**Server/Client Example - EchoServerApp, EchoClientApp**

**Server**

This program is an example of a TCP server application that listens for connections from clients and prints the messages sent by them.

1.ServerSocket Class
    * Used to create server programs that can accept client connections.
    * The ServerSocket constructor takes a port number to create a ServerSocket object that clients can connect to.

2.Creating the Server Socket

ServerSocket echoServer = new ServerSocket(3000);
~~~
System.out.println("[Message] Echo Server Running...");
~~~
   *  Creates a ServerSocket object listening on port 3000.
    * Throws IOException if the port is already in use or there is a network error.

3.Accepting Client Connections

while (true) {
~~~
Socket socket = echoServer.accept();
~~~
  *   The server enters an infinite loop to continually accept client connections.
    * accept() method waits (blocks) until a client connects, then returns a Socket object to communicate with the client.

4.Receiving and Printing Messages
~~~
BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));
System.out.println("[" + socket.getInetAddress().getHostAddress() + "] sent: " + in.readLine());
~~~
  *   Retrieves an InputStream from the Socket object to receive data from the client.
    * Wraps the InputStream in an InputStreamReader, then in a BufferedReader to read text data (strings) from the client.
    * Reads and prints the message sent by the client using readLine(), which waits if no message is available until a message is sent.

5.Closing the Client Connection
~~~
socket.close();
~~~
* Closes the connection with the client after the message is received and printed.

Exception Handling
    * Handles IOException for network errors, printing an error message if any issues arise.
    * Ensures that the ServerSocket is closed properly in the finally block, even if an error occurs.


### Full Code

public class EchoServerApp {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        ServerSocket echoServer = null;

        try {

            echoServer = new ServerSocket(3000);

            System.out.println("[Message] Echo Server Running...");

            while (true) {

                Socket socket = echoServer.accept();

                BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));

                System.out.println("[" + socket.getInetAddress().getHostAddress() + "] sent: " + in.readLine());

                socket.close();

            }

        } catch (IOException e) {

            System.out.println("[Error] A network error occurred on the server.");

        } finally {

            try {

                echoServer.close();

            } catch (IOException e) {

                e.printStackTrace();

            }

        }

    }
    }


This program listens on port 3000 for incoming client connections, receives messages from clients, prints the messages to the console, and then closes the connection. It handles network errors gracefully and ensures the server socket is closed properly when shutting down.

**Client**

This program is a TCP client application that reads a message from the keyboard and sends it to a server.

1.BufferedReader and InputStreamReader

* BufferedReader and InputStreamReader are used to read input from the keyboard (System.in).
* BufferedReader wraps the InputStreamReader to efficiently read characters, arrays, and lines.

2.Reading Input from the Keyboard
~~~
BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
String message = in.readLine();
~~~


* in.readLine() reads a line of text from the keyboard and stores it in the variable message.

3.Establishing Connection to the Server
~~~
Socket socket = new Socket("192.168.13.4", 3000);
~~~


* Connects to the server with the IP address "192.168.13.4" and port number 3000 using a Socket object.

4.Sending Message to the Server

    PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream());
    out.println(message);
    out.flush();



* PrintWriter is used to send data to the server through the output stream of the socket.
* out.println(message) sends the message entered by the user to the server.
* out.flush() flushes the output stream to ensure all data is sent to the server.

5.Handling Connection Errors

* Catches UnknownHostException if the server cannot be found and IOException if there is an error in connecting to the server.
* Prints an error message accordingly.

6.Closing the Connection
~~~
socket.close();
~~~
This program reads a message inputted by the user from the keyboard, establishes a connection to the server with the specified IP address and port number, sends the message to the server, and then closes the connection. It handles errors gracefully by providing appropriate error messages.


### Full Code
