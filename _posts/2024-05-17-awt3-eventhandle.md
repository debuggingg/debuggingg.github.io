# Event Handling Program

## Concepts:
- **Event Handling:** Dealing with various events that occur in components (containers) of a GUI program.
- **XXXListener Interfaces:** Interfaces used to handle events generated by event sources.
- **ActionEvent Class:** Represents an action event, such as button clicks, in Java.
- **Multi-threaded Programs:** Event handling programs inherently involve multiple threads.

## Program Flow:
1. **Create UI Class:** 
   - Inherit from container-related classes, typically the Frame class.
   - Various events can occur in the components used in UI classes, known as event sources.
   - XXXEvent objects containing event-related information are automatically generated when events occur.
     Example: When pressing a Button component, an object of the ActionEvent class is automatically created.
2. **Create Event Handling Class:** 
   - Inherit from XXXListener interfaces to handle events generated by event sources.
   - Override all abstract methods of the Listener interfaces and write event handling commands in the methods.
     Example: For ActionEvent, create a child class inheriting from ActionListener interface.
3. **Configure Event Source:** 
   - Use the `addXXXListener()` method to add an object of the event handling class to handle events generated by components.
   - A thread that detects events in the component is automatically created.
   - When an event occurs in the component, the event handling methods of the event handling object are automatically called.

## Full Code:

```java
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;

public class EventHandleApp extends Frame {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    public EventHandleApp(String title) {
        super(title);

        setLayout(new FlowLayout());
        Button exit = new Button("EXIT");
        exit.setFont(new Font(Font.SANS_SERIF, Font.BOLD, 30));
        add(exit);

        exit.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
            @Override
            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
                System.exit(0);
            }
        });

        setBounds(800, 200, 300, 300);
        setVisible(true);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new EventHandleApp("Event Handling");
    }
}
```

## Key Points:
- **Event Handling:** Dealing with various events that occur in components (containers) of a GUI program.
- **Event Handling Classes:** Inherit from XXXListener interfaces to handle events generated by event sources.
- **ActionEvent Handling:** Write event handling commands within the `actionPerformed` method of the ActionListener interface.
- **Multi-threaded Programs:** Event handling programs inherently involve multiple threads.

# Event Handling Program with Inner Class

## Concepts:
- **Event Handling:** Dealing with various events that occur in components (containers) of a GUI program.
- **Inner Classes:** Classes defined within other classes. Inner classes have access to the members of the enclosing class.
- **ActionEvent Class:** Represents an action event, such as button clicks, in Java.

## Program Flow:
1. **Create UI Class:** 
   - Inherit from container-related classes, typically the Frame class.
   - Create components like buttons and add them to the frame.
2. **Create Inner Event Handling Class:** 
   - Define an inner class within the UI class to handle events.
   - Inner classes have access to the members of the enclosing class, allowing them to interact with UI components.
3. **Configure Event Source:** 
   - Add an instance of the inner event handling class as an ActionListener to handle events generated by components.
   - When the [EXIT] button is clicked, the actionPerformed method of the inner class is triggered, exiting the program.

## Full Code:

```java
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;

public class EventInnerHandleApp extends Frame {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    public EventInnerHandleApp(String title) {
        super(title);

        setLayout(new FlowLayout());
        Button exit = new Button("EXIT");
        exit.setFont(new Font(Font.SANS_SERIF, Font.BOLD, 30));
        add(exit);

        // Instantiate the inner event handling class and add it as an ActionListener
        exit.addActionListener(new ButtonEventHandle());

        setBounds(800, 200, 300, 300);
        setVisible(true);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new EventInnerHandleApp("Event Handling");
    }

    // Inner class for event handling
    public class ButtonEventHandle implements ActionListener {
        @Override
        public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
            System.exit(0);
        }
    }
}
```

## Key Points:
- **Inner Classes:** Classes defined within other classes, providing encapsulation and access to outer class members.
- **ActionEvent Handling:** Write event handling commands within the `actionPerformed` method of the ActionListener interface.
- **Event Handling in Inner Classes:** Inner classes can access members of the enclosing class, allowing them to interact with UI components seamlessly.

# Event Handling Program with UI Class

## Concepts:
- **Event Handling:** Dealing with various events that occur in components (containers) of a GUI program.
- **ActionListener Interface:** Used to handle action events, such as button clicks, in Java.

## Program Flow:
1. **Create UI Class with Event Handling:**
   - The UI class implements the ActionListener interface to handle events within the same class.
   - Components like buttons are created and added to the frame.
2. **Register Event Listener:**
   - Add the UI class itself as an ActionListener to handle events generated by components.
   - When the [EXIT] button is clicked, the actionPerformed method of the UI class is triggered, exiting the program.

## Full Code:

```java
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;

public class EventUIHandleApp extends Frame implements ActionListener {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    public EventUIHandleApp(String title) {
        super(title);

        setLayout(new FlowLayout());
        Button exit = new Button("EXIT");
        exit.setFont(new Font(Font.SANS_SERIF, Font.BOLD, 30));
        add(exit);

        // Register the UI class itself as the ActionListener
        exit.addActionListener(this);

        setBounds(800, 200, 300, 300);
        setVisible(true);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new EventUIHandleApp("Event Handling");
    }

    @Override
    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
        System.exit(0);
    }
}
```
## Key Points:

- **ActionListener Interface:** Implement the ActionListener interface to handle action events within the same class.
- **this Keyword Usage:** Use the `this` keyword to refer to the current class instance when registering event listeners.

# Event Handling Program with Anonymous Inner Class

## Concepts:
- **Anonymous Inner Class:** A class defined without a name and instantiated at the same place where it is declared.

## Program Flow:
1. **Create UI Class with Button:**
   - The UI class extends Frame and adds an [EXIT] button to the frame.
2. **Register Event Listener:**
   - Use an anonymous inner class to create an ActionListener object to handle the button click event.
   - When the [EXIT] button is clicked, the actionPerformed method of the anonymous inner class is executed, exiting the program.

## Full Code:

```java
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;

public class EventAnonymousHandleApp extends Frame {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    public EventAnonymousHandleApp(String title) {
        super(title);

        setLayout(new FlowLayout());
        Button exit = new Button("EXIT");
        exit.setFont(new Font(Font.SANS_SERIF, Font.BOLD, 30));
        add(exit);

        // Register an anonymous inner class to handle the button click event
        exit.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
            @Override
            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
                System.exit(0);
            }
        });

        setBounds(800, 200, 300, 300);
        setVisible(true);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new EventAnonymousHandleApp("Event Handling");
    }
}
```
## Key Points:

- **Anonymous Inner Class:** Used to define and instantiate an event handling class at the same place where it is used.
- **ActionListener Interface:** Implemented anonymously to provide the actionPerformed method for handling button click events.
- **Compact Syntax:** The anonymous inner class provides a compact way to define event handling logic directly at the point of use.
