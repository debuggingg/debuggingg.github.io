# Servlet

## Basic 

### Concept 

#### Servlet
A Servlet is a small Java program that runs on a web server. It dynamically generates content, such as HTML, XML, or JSON, in response to client requests, typically through a Web Application Server (WAS).

#### Web Application Server (WAS)
A WAS executes web programs and provides a Web Container that manages web-related objects (create, use, delete).

#### Steps to Write a Servlet
1. **Extend HttpServlet Class**
   - Create a child class that extends `HttpServlet`.
   - Include JavaEE library (Apache Tomcat library).
   - Optionally declare `serialVersionUID` for object serialization.

2. **Override Request Processing Methods**
   - `doGet()`: Handles GET requests.
   - `doPost()`: Handles POST requests.
   - `service()`: Handles both GET and POST requests, with higher priority.

3. **Set Response Content Type**
   - Use `response.setContentType("text/html;charset=utf-8")` to set the MIME type and character encoding.

4. **Create Response Output Stream**
   - Use `response.getWriter()` for text-based responses.

5. **Process Request and Generate Response**
   - Write response content using `PrintWriter`.

6. **Configure Servlet**
   - Register the servlet in the `web.xml` file and map URL patterns.

### Program Flow

1. **Client Request**
   - The client sends a request to the server for a specific URL.

2. **Servlet Mapping**
   - The WAS checks the `web.xml` configuration to map the URL to a corresponding servlet.

3. **Servlet Instance Creation**
   - The WAS creates an instance of the servlet if it doesn’t already exist.

4. **Request Processing Method Invocation**
   - The WAS invokes the appropriate method (`doGet()`, `doPost()`, or `service()`) with `HttpServletRequest` and `HttpServletResponse` objects.

5. **Set Content Type**
   - The servlet sets the response content type using `response.setContentType()`.

6. **Create Output Stream**
   - The servlet creates a `PrintWriter` object using `response.getWriter()`.

7. **Generate Response**
   - The servlet writes the response content using the `PrintWriter` object.

8. **Send Response**
   - The WAS sends the generated response back to the client.

#### web.xml Configuration
```xml
<web-app>
    <servlet>
        <servlet-name>HelloServlet</servlet-name>
        <servlet-class>HelloServlet</servlet-class>
    </servlet>
    <servlet-mapping>
        <servlet-name>HelloServlet</servlet-name>
        <url-pattern>/hello</url-pattern>
    </servlet-mapping>
</web-app>
```

## Full Code
```java
/* Servlet: A compound word of Server and let, it refers to a simple program that runs on a web server
 => SSL: Server Script Language - Java Web Program
 => Servlet programs are executed by the WAS (Web Application Server) in response to client requests, dynamically generating HTML documents (XML documents, JSON documents, etc.) and responding to the client
WAS (Web Application Server): A program to execute web programs
 => Provides Web Container functionality that manages (creates, uses, deletes) Web-related objects */

/* How to write a Servlet (web program)
1. Create a child class that extends the HttpServlet class - Servlet class
 => To write a servlet, the JavaEE library (Apache Tomcat library) must be built into the project
 => It is recommended to declare the serialVersionUID field in the child class that extends the HttpServlet class as an object serialization class
 => When a client requests a servlet, the WAS program automatically creates an object of the servlet class */
public class HelloServlet extends HttpServlet {
	private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
	
	/*
	  2. Override the doGet() method or doPost() method - request processing methods
	  => Methods for writing commands to handle client requests and generate web documents as a result
	  => Request processing methods are automatically called by the WAS program
	  doGet(): Called when the client requests the servlet with the GET method
	  doPost(): Called when the client requests the servlet with the POST method
	  Instead of the doGet() or doPost() methods, the service() method can be overridden
	  => service(): Called when the client requests the servlet regardless of the request method
	  => The service() method has a higher priority than the doGet() or doPost() methods
	 * When the request processing method is called by the WAS program, the HttpServletRequest object (request object) and HttpServletResponse object (response object) are passed and stored as method parameters
	 */
	@Override
	protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
		// HttpServletRequest object: Represents and provides request message (request-related information)
		// HttpServletResponse object: Represents and provides response message (response-related information)
		
		/*
		 * 3. Change the file type (MimeType) to store the result of the client request processing and respond
		 * => Set the file type to be stored in the body of the response message (Entity Body)
		 * HttpServletResponse.setContentType(String mimeType[;charset=encoding])
		 * => Method to change the file type to be stored in the body of the response message
		 * => Set character type (CharacterSet - Encoding) if the file to be responded is a document
		 * If setContentType() method is not called, the default is [text/html;charset=iso-8859-1] - a Western European language HTML document response
		 */
		response.setContentType("text/html;charset=utf-8"); // Respond as an HTML document made in Korean (UTF-8)

		/*
		 * 4. Get the output stream to create the response file
		 * => Response file: The file to be stored in the body of the response message (Entity Body)
		 * HttpServletResponse.getOutputStream(): Returns the output stream (ServletOutputStream object) to create the response file
		 * => Returns the output stream to transmit raw data (1Byte) and create binary files such as image files, sound files, video files
		 * HttpServletResponse.getWriter(): Returns the output stream (PrintWriter object) to create the response file
		 * => Returns the output stream to transmit character data (2Byte) and create document files such as HTML files, XML files
		 */
		PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
		
		/*
		 * 5. Write the commands to process the client request and create the response file
		 * => Use the values provided by the HttpServletRequest object for the commands needed to process the request
		 * PrintWriter.println(Object obj): Converts any value passed as a parameter to a string and transmits it to the output stream - creates the response file
		 */
		out.println("<!DOCTYPE html>");
		out.println("<html>");
		out.println("<head>");
		out.println("<meta charset='utf-8'>");
		out.println("<title>Servlet</title>");
		out.println("</head>");
		out.println("<body>");
		out.println("<h1>Servlet</h1>");
		out.println("<hr>");
		out.println("<p>Hello, Servlet!!!</p>");
		out.println("</body>");
		out.println("</html>");
		
		/*
		 * 6. Configure the servlet class to run as a servlet (web program)
		 * => Register the servlet class as a servlet and map a URL address that can request the servlet in the [web.xml] file
		 * When a client requests the mapped URL address, the WAS program creates an object of the servlet class registered as a servlet, calls the request processing method, processes the request, creates the response file, and responds to the client
		 * => If the servlet class requested by the client is already created as an object, only the request processing method is called, and the request is processed and the response file is created and responded

## First Servlet


### Concept

**Servlet**: A Java program running on a web server that dynamically generates responses (HTML, XML, JSON, etc.) based on client requests. It operates within a Web Application Server (WAS), which provides a Web Container to manage the servlet lifecycle.

**Annotation (@WebServlet)**: Used to declare a Java class as a servlet and map it to a specific URL pattern. It simplifies the configuration compared to the traditional web.xml file.

- **@WebServlet Attributes**:
  - **name**: Specifies the servlet's name (optional; defaults to the class name if omitted).
  - **value**: Specifies the URL pattern for the servlet (mandatory if no other attributes are present).

**HttpServlet**: The base class for all servlets, which provides methods like `doGet()`, `doPost()`, and `service()` to handle client requests. 

### Program Flow

1. **Servlet Initialization**:
   - The servlet class `FirstServlet` is defined and annotated with `@WebServlet("/first.itwill")`.
   - This annotation automatically registers the servlet and maps it to the URL pattern `/first.itwill`.

2. **Client Request**:
   - A client makes a request to the URL `/first.itwill`.

3. **WAS Handling**:
   - The Web Application Server (WAS) receives the request and maps it to the `FirstServlet` based on the URL pattern.
   - If not already instantiated, the WAS creates an instance of `FirstServlet`.

4. **Service Method Execution**:
   - The WAS calls the `service()` method of the `FirstServlet`.
   - The `service()` method processes the client request and generates the response.

5. **Response Generation**:
   - The `service()` method sets the content type of the response to `text/html;charset=utf-8`.
   - A `PrintWriter` object is obtained from the response to write the HTML content.
   - The current date and time are retrieved using a `Date` object.
   - The date and time are formatted into a readable string using `SimpleDateFormat`.

6. **HTML Response**:
   - An HTML document is dynamically created with the formatted date and time.
   - The HTML includes a script to refresh the page every second, showing the current time.

7. **Response Delivery**:
   - The dynamically generated HTML is sent back to the client as the response.

// Annotation: A data type (interface) that provides auxiliary functions for program execution

/* @WebServlet: An annotation to register a servlet class as a servlet and map a URL pattern
 => Equivalent to the functionality provided by the servlet element and servlet-mapping element in the [web.xml] file
@WebServlet annotation attributes can be used to set the servlet's name and map URL patterns
 => Annotation attributes are written within parentheses and separated by commas
 => name attribute: Sets the servlet's name as the attribute value - if omitted, the class name is automatically set as the servlet name
 => value attribute: Sets the URL pattern to request the servlet - this attribute cannot be omitted
 => If there are no attributes other than the value attribute, only the attribute value can be set
@WebServlet(name="first", value="/first.itwill") */
@WebServlet("/first.itwill")
public class FirstServlet extends HttpServlet {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    // Method automatically called by client request - request handling method
    // => Write commands to handle client requests and generate response files with the results
    protected void service(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        // Change file format to store the result of client request processing and save the output stream for generating the response file
        // => Can be omitted if responding with a URL instead of a file to the client
        response.setContentType("text/html;charset=utf-8");
        PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();

        // Write commands for request processing
        // => A servlet dynamically generates and responds with a file that has consistent results for all clients
        // Create a Date object storing the current date and time of the server platform
        Date now = new Date();

        // Create and store a SimpleDateFormat object with date and time pattern information
        SimpleDateFormat dateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy년 MM월 dd일 HH시 mm분 ss초");

        // Call the format() method on the SimpleDateFormat object to convert the Date object passed as a parameter into a string with the pattern stored in the SimpleDateFormat object, then save the result
        String displayNow = dateFormat.format(now);

        // Generate a file with the result and respond
        out.println("<!DOCTYPE html>");
        out.println("<html>");
        out.println("<head>");
        out.println("<meta charset='utf-8'>");

        out.println("width: 600px;");
        out.println("margin: 0 auto;");
        out.println("padding: 30px 0;");

## Send Image Servlet

### Concept

**Servlet**: A Java program running on a web server that dynamically generates responses based on client requests. It operates within a Web Application Server (WAS), which provides a Web Container to manage the servlet lifecycle.

**Annotation (@WebServlet)**: Used to declare a Java class as a servlet and map it to a specific URL pattern, simplifying the configuration compared to the traditional web.xml file.

**HttpServlet**: The base class for all servlets, providing methods like `service()` to handle client requests.

### Program Flow

1. **Servlet Initialization**:
   - The servlet class `SendImageServlet` is defined and annotated with `@WebServlet("/image.itwill")`.
   - This annotation automatically registers the servlet and maps it to the URL pattern `/image.itwill`.

2. **Client Request**:
   - A client makes a request to the URL `/image.itwill`.

3. **WAS Handling**:
   - The Web Application Server (WAS) receives the request and maps it to the `SendImageServlet` based on the URL pattern.
   - If not already instantiated, the WAS creates an instance of `SendImageServlet`.

4. **Service Method Execution**:
   - The WAS calls the `service()` method of the `SendImageServlet`.
   - The `service()` method processes the client request and generates the response.

5. **Response Generation**:
   - The `service()` method sets the content type of the response to `image/jpeg`.
   - A `ServletOutputStream` object is obtained from the response to write the image content.
   - The system path of the image file is retrieved using `request.getServletContext().getRealPath("/WEB-INF/Koala.jpg")`.

6. **Image File Reading and Response**:
   - An `FileInputStream` object is created to read the image file.
   - The image data is read from the input stream and written to the output stream in a loop until all data is read.
   - The input stream is closed after the data transfer is complete.

7. **Response Delivery**:
   - The binary image data is sent back to the client as the response.

## Full Code

```java
// Servlet to respond with an image file to the client's request
// => Reads the file (/WEB-INF/Koala.jpg) and responds to the client
// => The [WEB-INF] and [META-INF] folders are hidden folders only accessible by the servlet (web application)
// and are not accessible by client requests
@WebServlet("/image.itwill")
public class SendImageServlet extends HttpServlet {
	private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

	protected void service(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
		// Change the response file type to respond with an image file (JPEG file)
		// => Since the response file is not a document file, no character set is set
		response.setContentType("image/jpeg");
		
		// Get the output stream to create the response file (image file)
		// => Get and save the ServletOutputStream object, which transmits the raw data to create a binary file
		ServletOutputStream out = response.getOutputStream();
		
		// Get and save the system path of the image file stored on the server
		// HttpServletRequest.getServletContext(): Returns the ServletContext object (WAS) that created the HttpServletRequest object
		// ServletContext.getRealPath(String contextPath): Returns the file system path of the web resource passed as a parameter
		String imageFilePath = request.getServletContext().getRealPath("/WEB-INF/Koala.jpg");
		// System.out.println("imageFilePath = " + imageFilePath); // Print to server console
		
		// Create and save an input stream (FileInputStream object) to read the image file
		// => Pass the file system path of the image file to the constructor of the FileInputStream class
		FileInputStream in = new FileInputStream(imageFilePath);
		
		// Read raw data from the input stream and pass it to the output stream - process in a loop
		// => Create the response file to transmit the image file stored on the server to the client - copy the file
		while (true) {
			int readByte = in.read();
			if (readByte == -1) break;
			out.write(readByte);
		}
		
		in.close(); // Close the file input stream
	}
}
