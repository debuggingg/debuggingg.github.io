	<h1>JavaScript Objects</h1>
	<hr>
	<p>JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that uses objects to structure programs. Every value in JavaScript can be represented as an object.</p>
	<p>An object is a value representing a specific entity with properties (attributes) and methods (functions).</p>
	<p>Instead of using class data types, JavaScript uses constructor functions (prototypes) to create objects. The <code>new</code> operator is used to call a constructor function and create an object.</p>
	<p>Using constructor functions allows the creation of multiple objects with the same properties and methods, improving productivity and maintainability.</p>	
	
	<script type="text/javascript">
	// Constructor function (Prototype) definition - a special function to create objects
	// Constructor functions are named with a capital letter to distinguish them from regular functions
	// Parameters are used to initialize properties
	function Student(num, name, address) {
		// 'this' keyword refers to the object instance created by the constructor function
		
		// Defining object properties using 'this' keyword
		this.num = num;
		this.name = name;
		this.address = address;
	}
	
	// Adding methods to the constructor function using the prototype property
	// This way, methods are shared across all instances, saving memory
	Student.prototype = {
		display: function() {
			alert("Student ID = " + this.num + ", Name = " + this.name + ", Address = " + this.address);
		},
		setValue: function(num, name, address) {
			this.num = num;
			this.name = name;
			this.address = address;
		}
	};
	
	// Creating objects using the constructor function
	// Using the 'new' operator to call the constructor function and create an object
	var student1 = new Student(1000, "Paul", "Seoul Gangnam");
	var student2 = new Student(2000, "Sung", "Seoul Sonpa");
	
	// Displaying properties and methods of the created objects
	student1.display();
	student2.display();
	</script>
</body>
</html>
```


- **Constructor Function**:
   - The `Student` constructor function initializes new objects with the given `num`, `name`, and `address` properties.

-  **Prototype**:
   - Methods (`display` and `setValue`) are added to the `Student` prototype, ensuring that all instances of `Student` share these methods, optimizing memory usage.

-  **Object Creation**:
   - Objects `student1` and `student2` are created using the `new` operator, invoking the `Student` constructor function.

-  **Displaying Properties**:
   - The `display` method is called on both `student1` and `student2` to show their properties.
---

## Class

-  **Class Definition**:
   - The `Human` class is defined with a constructor to initialize the `num` property.
   - The `Student` class extends the `Human` class and adds `name` and `address` properties. It also includes methods `display` and `setValue`.

-  **Object Creation**:
   - An instance of the `Student` class is created using the `new` operator, and its properties are initialized through the constructor.

-  **Method Invocation**:
   - The `display` method is called to show student details.
   - The `setValue` method is called to update student details, and `display` is called again to show the updated details.

-  **Property Access**:
   - Object properties and methods are accessed using both dot notation (`student.display()`) and bracket notation (`student["display"]()`).

-  **Type Checking**:
   - The `instanceof` operator checks whether `student` is an instance of `Student` and `Human`.

-  **Property Existence Checking**:
   - The `in` operator checks if certain properties exist within the `student` object.

-  **Iteration over Properties**:
   - A `for...in` loop iterates over the properties of the `student` object, displaying each property and its value.

-  **Convenient Property Access**:
   - The `with` statement is used to access multiple properties of the `student` object more conveniently.

	<p>In ES6, the class keyword allows you to define a class and create objects using the new operator to call the class constructor. Internally, this is still handled using constructor functions (prototypes).</p>
